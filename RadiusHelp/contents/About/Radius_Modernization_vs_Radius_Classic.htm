  <h1>Radius Modernized vs Radius Classic - Enhancements and Differences</h1>
  <p class="modernbody">The release of the Radius Modernization project provides a wide selection of new features and enhancements, as well as introducing quality of life workflow changes.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">While the majority of the Radius classic workflow has been preserved, some nuanced changes have been implemented, which provide heaps of benefit and added flexibility towards how you work in Radius.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">The following information gives a high-level comparison between the modernized and classic Radius releases, describing the changes that have been implemented and provides high-level instructions on using the new functionality.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">Supplementary information is provided within the help, including detailed instructions on creating sales order, shipping requests and navigating the Radius modernized application.</p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule"/>
  </div>
  <h2>Modernized User Experience and User Interface Design</h2>
  <p class="modernbody">The most fundamental change to the modernized Radius release is the sleek and intuitive redesign of the application front-end. Not only does this provide a more attractive and easy to use work environment, but also gives you complete control over the which fields are available in your Radius windows and how they are displayed, in the form of &quot;views&quot;.</p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule-inner"/>
  </div>
  <h3>Navigation</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">The modernized interface means that navigating Radius has never been easier, it&#39;s now much quicker to find the pages and information you need.</p>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Step-Text"><strong>Note</strong>: For detailed information on navigation the Radius web application, see <a href="../Tutorials/Navigation.htm">Navigation</a>.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">The following new and enhanced features have been introduced to facilitate this:</p>
  <ul class="Bullets">
    <li class="modernbody">Many of the fields (such as sales order numbers) are hyperlinked, and open their respective page when clicked. </li>
    <li class="modernbody">An advanced search version of the Radius has been introduced (modeled after the Radius Classic Estimating Advanced Search), which allows you to build fast and powerful search queries.</li>
    <li class="modernbody">Some of the Radius classic windows have been re-imagined as tabs, so that you can more easily follow your workflow without additional navigation. For example, the Radius classic shipping and invoice functionality have been encapsulated by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Shipping </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Invoice Details </span>tabs on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Orders</span> page.</li>
    <li class="modernbody">You can now declutter your page view with the introduction of collapsible details - simply click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hide <img height="20" src="../assets/Images/hide_section.png" width="20"/> </span>next to a section to collapse it, then click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Show  <img height="21" src="../assets/Images/show_section.png" width="20"/> </span>to expand it when you want to see the details. </li>
    <li class="modernbody">You can edit the first order line of a sales order directly form the landing page by hovering over <strong>More Options</strong> <img height="20" src="../assets/Images/More.png" width="20"/>  next to the respective sales order in the table and selecting <strong>Edit Sales Order Line</strong>. The line record opens on the <strong>Order Lines</strong> tab of the  <strong>Sales Orders</strong> page. </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left"> </div>
  <hr class="hrule-inner"/>
  <h3>Advanced Search</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">The search bar at the top of the page provides the standard Radius navigation search, however you now can build advanced search queries (like you can in the Estimating Advanced Search) for your other records.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">To access the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced Search Filters</span> window, click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced Search</span> <img height="20" src="../assets/Images/advanced_search.png" width="20"/> next to the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Search Sales Order</span> lookup.</p>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Step-Text"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: For detailed information on the advanced search, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="About_the_Advanced_Search.htm">About the Advanced Search</a> and <a href="../Tutorials/How_to_Use_the_Advanced_Search.htm">How to Use the Advanced Search </a>.</p>
  <p><img height="" src="../assets/gifs/advancedsearch.gif" width="100%"/></p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule-inner"/>
  </div>
  <h3>View and Layout Customization</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">When viewing a window in the classic Radius system, what you saw was what you got. Aside from UDEs, fields were static and unable to be changed. This meant that you were locked in to how you interacted with the application, and could be overwhelmed with optional fields that you had no intention of using.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">The modernized Radius application takes the opposite approach, with the introduction of view and layout customization allowing you to tailor build your Radius experience. You can now change the position of fields on the fly and decide which ones appear on your pages. The table columns can be easily reordered with drag and drop functionality, and you can decide which fields are mandatory.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">Once you have customized a page to how you want it, you can then save it as a view. Views can be shared with other users, and even set as default at an administrative level.</p>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Step-Text"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: For detailed instructions on creating, saving, and assigning permissions for views and layouts, see  <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Tutorials/How_to_Create_Views_and_Layouts.htm">How to Create Views and Layouts</a>.</p>
  <div class="tablink-navigation">
    <div class="tablink-center" style="text-align:center;"><button class="defaultopen tablink tablink-left" onclick="openTab(&#39;Tab1&#39;, this, &#39;#aaaaaa&#39;)">Classic</button><button class="tablink tablink-right" onclick="openTab(&#39;Tab2&#39;, this, &#39;#aaaaaa&#39;)">Modern</button> </div>
  </div>
  <div class="tabcontent" id="Tab1">
    <p class="modernbody">In the classic Radius system, you had to manually search for sales order records and filter them by their Status in order to view a refined list of them. You then had to select each record you wanted to edit and click multiple buttons in order to edit them.</p>
    <img height="" src="../assets/gifs/ClassicFilterByStatus.gif" style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; border-width: 1px; border-style: ridge; border-color: rgb(195, 195, 195);" width="90%"/>
  </div>
  <div class="tabcontent" id="Tab2">
    <p class="modernbody">In the Modern Radius system, you can simply click one of your predefined views in order to filter which sales order records are displayed. You can then quickly and easily inline edit each record.</p>
    <img height="" src="../assets/gifs/FilterByStatusModern.gif" style="display: block; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border-width: 1px; border-style: ridge; border-color: #c3c3c3;" width="90%"/>
  </div>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule"/>
  </div>
  <h2>Shipping Differences</h2>
  <p class="modernbody">While the workflow for shipping remains primarily the same, there have been some key changes made to bring continuity to how shipping requests are generated, which also provides a far more dynamic approach to how to perform shipments.</p>
  <h3>Header – Lines Relationship</h3>
  <p class="modernbody"><span style="font-family:Inter;font-size:1rem">In the classic version of Radius, while shipping requests generated in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Orders &gt; Shipping Requests</span> window followed a header – lines relationship, requests generated by clicking the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Generate Shipping Requests</span> button on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Order Lines</span> tab of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Orders</span> window did not.</span></p>
  <p class="modernbody">In the modernized version, only the header shipping lines method of shipping request generation is used. Furthermore, you can attach shipping lines to a header that were generates from different sales orders and plants; the header is simply details of the shipment; the lines are anything you want to send with that shipment.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">Additionally, whereas in the old Radius system you had to enter the amount of goods to ship as a percentage of the requirement, you now just need to enter the number of goods you are shipping.</p>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Step-Text"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: For detailed information on the about shipping, see <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Tutorials/How_to_Create_a_Shipping_Request.htm">How to Create a Shipping Request</a>.</p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule-inner"/>
  </div>
  <h3>Address Creation Limitation</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">In the classic Radius system you could create a new address when adding one to a sales order, by clicking the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Add/Edit</span> button in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Address Lookup</span> window, accessed from the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Order Details</span> tab of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Orders Sales Orders</span> window.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">However this feature is not yet implemented in the modernized version of the Radius application.</p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule"/>
  </div>
  <h2 class="modernbody">Unit of Measure Enhancements</h2>
  <p class="modernbody">Units of measure could prove quite finicky in the classic Radius application. Whether you worked in metric or imperial units was controlled at company level, and it took a lot of navigation and clicks to switch between the two.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">The modern release of Radius has not only made it much simpler to view your unit conversion, but now also lets you switch between metric and imperial measurements on the fly. </p>
  <h3>Switching Between Metric / Imperial</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">Switching between metric and imperial measurements in the classic Radius system was quite inconvenient. To switch the unit, you had to select or deselect the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Metric </span>check box on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">General</span> tab of the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Company &gt; Options &gt; Company Level Options</span> window, which updated every size field for the entire currently signed in company. </p>
  <p class="modernbody">Now, you can easily swap between imperial and metric values by simply clicking the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Imperial</span> <img height="22" src="../assets/Images/inch.png" width="30"/> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Metric</span> <img height="22" src="../assets/Images/mm.png" width="30"/> buttons next to any <span style="font-weight:bold;">Size </span>field. </p>
  <p class="modernbody"><img height="" src="../assets/Images/Imp_to_Met.png" width="75%"/></p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule-inner"/>
  </div>
  <h3>Quantity Conversions</h3>
  <p class="modernbody">In the classic Radius application, when entering a sales order line quantity, you could view a quantity conversion for the item order line unit to your other units by clicking the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Item Quantity Conversions</span> button next to the quantity field to open the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Item Quantity <span style="font-weight:bold;">Conversions</span></span> window. However, you were limited to viewing only the conversion for the quantity entered on the sales order line and only the quantities of the same unit type.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">The new <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Item Quantity Conversion </span>window, however, allows you to easily convert any item quantities across all your units of measure. To access the window click <span style="font-weight:bold;">Quantity conversion</span> <img height="18" src="../assets/Images/QuantityConversionDetails.png" width="20"/>, the button located next to the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Quantity </span>fields throughout Radius. </p>
  <p class="modernbody">Simply enter a value into any of the unit fields within the window, then press the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Enter </span>key or click outside of the field, and all the other fields are updated with their equivalent value. </p>
  <p class="modernbody"><img height="" src="../assets/Images/ItemQuantityConversions_Classic.png" style="margin-left: 4%;" width="45%"/> <img height="" src="../assets/gifs/QuantityConversion.gif" style="margin-right: 4%;" width="45%"/></p>
  <div class="horizontal-rule-align-left">
    <hr class="hrule"/>
  </div>
  <h2>File Attachments</h2>
  <p class="modernbody">Another great benefit of the Radius modernization release is the ability to attach files to your sales orders. While in the classic Radius system some of the windows supported the attachment of link files for things such as artwork, you couldn&#39;t attach files to your sales orders.</p>
  <p class="modernbody">Files are attached to sales orders via the <span style="font-weight:bold;">File and Link Attachment</span> window, accessed by hovering over <span style="font-weight:bold;">More Items</span>  <img height="19" src="../assets/Images/MoreItems.png" width="20"/> in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Order Details</span> section of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sales Orders</span> (Add / Edit) page and selecting <span style="font-weight:bold;">Files Attachment</span> <img height="18" src="../assets/Images/FilesAttachment.png" width="20"/>from the menu. </p>
  <p class="Tip-Note-Step-Text"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note</span>: For detailed instructions on attaching files to sales orders, see Step 2a in  <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Tutorials/How_to_Create_a_Sales_Order.htm">How to Create a Sales Order</a>.</p>
  <p class="modernbody"><img height="" src="../assets/Images/FileAndLinkAttchment.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="50%"/></p>
  <p class="modernbody">By default, Radius allows.pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .doc, .docx, .png, .jpeg and .img file formats to be uploaded. The maximum number of files that can be uploaded is also limited to five, with a maximum file size of 10MB for each file. However, you can change these settings in the  <a data-xref="{title}" href="../WindowsMod/Admin_Settings.htm">Admin Settings</a> page or circumvent them by alternatively adding a weblink to the files. See  <a data-xref="{title}" href="../Tutorials/Configuring_File_Attachment_Settings.htm">Configuring File Attachment Settings</a> for more details.</p>
